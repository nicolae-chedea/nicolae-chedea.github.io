![Visisted countries so far]({static}/images/countries_been.jpg)

After living my first 20 years of life in close proximity of home, I have now visited close to a quarter of the countries of the world (mostly in Europe).

I enjoy travelling a lot because I feel that it opens my mind to new cultures and ways of thinking and in certain countries, I have my boundaries pushed. This helps me in my day to day life, I am less anxious about the unknown.

I like travelling with other people. You really get to know someone, his true nature, when you get to stay with him/her for several days, in close proximity, eat, drink and spend many hours together.

Last trip: Basel, Europa Park, Triberg, Colmar

Future trip: Abu Dhabi, Dubai
